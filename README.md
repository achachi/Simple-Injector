A simple injector that implements the C# InjectionLibrary by Jason to keep things simple on the front end while supporting LoadLibrary, Manual Mapping, and Thread Hijacking injection methods.

Allows for DLL ejection by calling ProcessDetach. Proper DLL ejection from that point is in your hands.

This is specifically designed to be used for offline testing purposes only.

Now supports saving and loading of configs.
